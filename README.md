# R Analysis of Seattle Mariners 2020 Baseball Team 

My first project in R analyzing the performance of the 2020 Seattle Mariners baseball team. While the analysis of the dataset was pretty basic, the data still provides some interesting conclusions about the team. I performed several test such as a two sample t-test of walks vs at-bats, a one-sample t-test for triples, calculating the mean batting average of the team, a linear scatterplot showing the number of runs-batted-in (RBIs) vs tne number of at-bats (AB), and displayed a bar chart relating the number of players and how many home runs they hit.
