Basic R analysis on Seattle Mariners 2020 Baseball team. 

My first project in R. While the analysis of the dataset was pretty basic, the data still provides some interesting conclusions about the team. I performed several test such as a two sample t-test of walks vs at-bats, a one-sample t-test for triples, calculating the mean batting average of the team, and displayed a bar chart relating the number of players and how many home runs they hit.
